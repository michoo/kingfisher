# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.67.0]
- Added checksum to GitLab rule
- Fixed deduplication to consider rule identifiers so overlapping patterns are not merged before validation

## [v1.66.0]
- Updating to support Bitbucket App Passwords
- Improved boundaries for several rules
- Added more rules

## [v1.65.0]
- Skip reporting MongoDB and Postgres findings when their connection strings cannot be parsed, even when validation is disabled.
- Improve MySQL detection by broadening URI coverage and adding live validation that skips clearly invalid connection strings.
- Added a helper to truncate validation response bodies only at UTF-8 character boundaries to prevent panics during validation.

## [v1.64.0]
- Fixed a bug when using --redact, that broke validation
- Added JDBC rule with validator
- Filter out empty 'KF_BITBUCKET_*' environment values when constructing the Bitbucket authentication configuration so blank variables no longer override valid credentials

## [v1.63.1]
- Updated allocator

## [v1.63.0]
- Fixed bug when retrieving some finding values and injecting them as TOKENS in the rule templates
- Improved Datadog rule
- Improved AWS rule

## [v1.62.0]
- Added `pattern_requirements` checks to rules, providing lightweight post-regex character-class validation without lookarounds. See docs/RULES.md for detail
- Added an `ignore_if_contains` option to `pattern_requirements` to drop matches containing case-insensitive placeholder words, with tests covering the new behavior.
- Updated rules to adopt the new `pattern_requirements` support.
- Added checksum comparisons to `pattern_requirements`, new `suffix`, `crc32`, and `base62` Liquid filters, and verbose logging so mismatched checksums are skipped with context rather than reported as findings.
- Split GitHub token detections into fine-grained/fixed-format variants and enforce checksum validation for modern GitHub token families (PAT, OAuth, App, refresh) while preserving legacy coverage.
- Added a rule for Zuplo tokens.
- Added checksum calculation for Confluent, GitHub, and Zuplo tokens, which can drastically reduce false positive reports.
- Improved OpsGenie validation.
- Automatically enable `--no-dedup` when `--manage-baseline` is supplied so baseline management keeps every finding.
- This release is focused on further improving detection accuracy, before even attempting to validate findings.
- Updated GitHub Actions CI for Windows and buildwin.bat script

## [v1.61.0]
- Fixed local filesystem scans to keep `open_path_as_is` enabled when opening Git repositories and only disable it for diff-based scans.
- Created Linux and Windows specific installer script
- Updated diff-focused scanning so `--branch-root-commit` can be provided alongside `--branch`, letting you diff from a chosen commit while targeting a specific branch tip (still defaulting back to the `--branch` ref when the commit is omitted).
- Updated rules

## [v1.60.0]
- Removed the `--bitbucket-username`, `--bitbucket-token`, and `--bitbucket-oauth-token` flags in favour of `KF_BITBUCKET_*` environment variables when authenticating to Bitbucket.
- Added provider-specific `kingfisher scan` subcommands (for example `kingfisher scan github …`) that translate into the legacy flags under the hood. The new layout keeps backwards compatibility while removing the wall of provider options from `kingfisher scan --help`.
- Updated the README so every provider example (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, Gitea, Hugging Face, Slack, Jira, Confluence, S3, GCS, Docker) uses the new subcommand style.
- Legacy provider flags (for example `--github-user`, `--gitlab-group`, `--bitbucket-workspace`, `--s3-bucket`) still work but now emit a deprecation warning to encourage migration to the new `kingfisher scan <provider>` flow.
- Kept the direct `kingfisher scan /path/to/dir` flow for local filesystem / local git repo scans while adding a `--list-only` switch to each provider subcommand so repository enumeration no longer requires the standalone `github repos`, `gitlab repos`, etc. commands.
- Removed the legacy top-level provider commands (`kingfisher github`, `kingfisher gitlab`, `kingfisher gitea`, `kingfisher bitbucket`, `kingfisher azure`, `kingfisher huggingface`) now that enumeration lives under `kingfisher scan <provider> --list-only`.

## [v1.59.0]
- Fixed `kingfisher scan github …` (and other provider-specific subcommands) so they no longer demand placeholder path arguments before the CLI accepts the request.
- Fixed `kingfisher scan` so that providing `--branch` without `--since-commit` now diffs the branch against the empty tree and scans every commit reachable from that branch.
- Added rules for meraki, duffel, finnhub, frameio, freshbooks, gitter, infracost, launchdarkly, lob, maxmind, messagebird, nytimes, prefect, scalingo, sendinblue, sentry, shippo, twitch, typeform

- ## [v1.58.0]
- Added first-class Hugging Face scanning support, including CLI enumeration, token authentication, and integration with remote scans.
- Condensed GitError formatting to report the exit status and the first informative lines from stdout/stderr, producing concise git clone failure logs.
- Added support for scanning Google Cloud Storage buckets via `--gcs-bucket`, including optional prefixes and service-account authentication.
- Added `--skip-aws-account` (now accepting comma-separated values) and `--skip-aws-account-file` to bypass live AWS validation for known canary/honey-token account IDs without triggering alerts. Kingfisher now ships with several canary AWS account IDs pre-seeded in the skip list and now reports matching findings as "Not Attempted" with the "Response" containing "(skip list entry)" so it's clear that validation was intentionally skipped and why.
  
## [v1.57.0]
- Added inline ignore directive detection to treat suppression tokens anywhere on surrounding lines, including multi-line handling
- Added a `--no-ignore` CLI flag to disable inline directives when you need every potential secret reported
- Added: repeatable `--ignore-comment <TOKEN>` flag to reuse inline directives from other scanners (for example `NOSONAR`, `kics-scan ignore`, `gitleaks:allow`, etc)
- Respect user color settings in update messages by using the same color helper as the main reporter, ensuring consistent output and no ANSI codes on update check, when color is disabled

## [v1.56.0]
- Fixed tree-sitter scanning bug where passing --no-base64 caused errors to be printed when the file type couldn’t be determined

## [v1.55.0]
- Added first-class Azure Repos support, including CLI commands, enumeration, and documentation updates
- Improved performance of tree-sitter parsing

## [v1.54.0]
- Added first-class Gitea support, including CLI commands, environment-based authentication, documentation, and integration with scans and repository enumeration.
- Populate the finding path from git blob metadata so history-derived secrets display their file location instead of an empty path
- Replaced Match::finding_id’s SHA1-based hashing with a fast xxh3_64 digest that keeps IDs deterministic while eliminating a hot-path SHA1 dependency

## [v1.53.0]
- Added first-class Bitbucket support, including CLI commands, authentication helpers, documentation, and integration testing.

## [v1.52.0]
- Enabled ANSI formatting in the tracing formatter whenever stderr is attached to a terminal so colorized updater messages render correctly instead of showing escape sequences. 
- Added a new CLI flag, `--user-agent-suffix` to allow developers to append additional information to the user-agent
- Removed the unused --rlimit-nofile flag

## [1.51.0]
- Added diff-only Git scanning via `--since-commit` and `--branch`, including remote-aware ref resolution so CI jobs can pair `--git-url` clones with pull request branches

## [1.50.0]
- Added `--github-exclude` and `--gitlab-exclude` options to skip specific repositories when scanning or listing GitHub and GitLab sources, including support for gitignore-style glob patterns

## [1.49.0]

## [1.48.0]
- Improved error message when self-update cannot find the current binary
- Optimized memory usage via string interning and extensive data sharing
- Replaced quadratic match filtering with a per-rule span map, fixing missed secrets in extremely large files and improving scan performance
- Support scanning extremely large files by chunking input into 1 GiB segments with small overlaps, avoiding vectorscan buffer limits while preserving match offsets
- Always use chunked vectorscan, eliminating the slow regex fallback for blobs over 4 GiB
- Skip Base64 scanning for blobs over 64 MB to avoid a second pass over massive files
- Increased max-file-size default to 64 MB (up from 25 MB)

## [1.47.0]
